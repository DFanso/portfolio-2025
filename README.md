# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! You can visit the live site at [itsme.dfanso.dev](https://itsme.dfanso.dev/).

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website built with modern web technologies to showcase my work and skills. The site is built using Next.js and features a clean, professional design.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework for production
- TypeScript
- Modern UI/UX principles
- Responsive Design
- [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project Structure

The project follows Next.js 13+ app directory structure:

```
├── app/          # Main application code
├── components/   # Reusable React components
├── public/       # Static assets
└── styles/       # CSS and styling files
```
